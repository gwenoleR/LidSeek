# Why this project ?

Lidarr is great, so why is this necessary?

A few months ago, MusicBrainz did a major update to their database. Since then, Lidarr [has not been working anymore.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lidarr/comments/1ktitdq/searching_for_new_artists_failedunable_to).

According to the community, it will take time to be restored, and maybe Lidarr is dead.

Moreover, indexers are great for finding media like movies or TV shows, but they give poor results for music.

This is why LidSeek was created.

# How does LidSeek work?

LidSeek is a self-hosted application that automates music album downloads using Soulseek, with a workflow inspired by Lidarr. It integrates with the MusicBrainz database to provide accurate artist and album information. The main features include:

- **Artist and Album Search:** Search for artists and browse their discography using data from MusicBrainz.
- **Album Selection:** Select one or more albums you want to add to your library.
- **Automated Download:** LidSeek manages Soulseek downloads in the background, handling search, download, and file organization automatically.
- **Library Management:** Downloaded albums are organized into a structured library, and you can view your collection through the web interface.
- **Background Tasks:** The app uses background task management to handle multiple downloads and track their status.
- **Configurable:** Settings such as download paths, logging, and Soulseek credentials can be customized.

LidSeek is designed to be easy to use, requiring minimal manual intervention once set up. It is ideal for users who want to automate music collection management without relying on traditional indexers.
